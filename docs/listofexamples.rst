impermeable) and that the normal component of its gradient vanishes (no
slip)

:math:`\phi` of the perturbation, giving a two-point boundary value problem      
:math:`\alpha\phi(\pm 1) = \phi'(\pm 1) = 0`
for a complex fourth-order ordinary differential equation,

     (c - U)\left(\alpha^2-\frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dz^2}\right)\phi
     - U''\phi,
   \right\}

Reynolds number.
