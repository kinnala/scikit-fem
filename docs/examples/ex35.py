"""Computation of the characteristic impedance and velocity factor of RG316
coaxial cable.

.. note::
   This example requires the external package
   `pygmsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_.

This example solves the series inductance (per meter) and parallel capacitance
(per meter)
of RG316 coaxial cable. These values are then used to compute the
characteristic impedance and velocity factor of the cable.

From transmission line theory it is known, that the characteristic impedance
of a lossless transmission line is

.. math::
   Z = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}},

while the phase velocity is

.. math::
   v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}},

where :math:`L` is the series inductance per unit length of the transmission
line and :math:`C` is the parallel capacitance per unit length of the
transmission line.

Further, the phase velocity relative to the speed of light is called the
velocity factor of the transmission line.

RG316
-----

A piece of coaxial cable is composed of an inner conductor, which is
surrounded by a dielectric insulator.
The dielectric insulator in turn is surrounded by an outer conductor. Finally,
the outer conductor is surrounded by an outer insulator.

For an RG316 cable, the dimensions and materials of the components are

- Inner conductor: OD 0.5mm, silver plated copper
- Inner insulator: OD 1.52mm, PTFE
- Outer conductor: OD 1.98mm, silver plated copper
- Outer insulator: OD 2.48mm, PEF

RG316 has a nominal characteristic impedance of 50 ohms and a velocity factor
of 0.69.

Inductance
----------

Inductance of the cable is computed using the magnetostatic equations

.. math::
   \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B} = 0

   \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{H} = \\boldsymbol{J}

and the constitutive relation

.. math::
   \\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{H},

where :math:`\\mu` is the permability of the medium.

Since :math:`\\boldsymbol{B}` is divergence free, it can be written in terms
of a vector potential :math:`\\boldsymbol{A}` as

.. math::
   \\boldsymbol{B} = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}.

Thus we have the strong form for the vector potential :math:`\\boldsymbol{A}`
as

.. math::
   \\nabla \\times (\\mu^{-1} \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}) =
   \\boldsymbol{J}.

The corresponding weak form is: find :math:`\\boldsymbol{A} \\in V` such that

.. math::
   \\int_{\\Omega}
   (\\mu^{-1} \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}) \\cdot
   (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{v})\\ \\mathrm{d}x -
   \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}
   (\\mu^{-1} \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}) \\times
   \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}\\ \\mathrm{d}x =
   \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}\\ \\mathrm{d}x
   \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{v} \\in V.

We take the boundary condition
:math:`\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0` on
:math:`\\partial \\Omega`, which is equivalent to
:math:`\\boldsymbol{A} = 0` on
:math:`\\partial \\Omega`. This is an essential boundary condition, which is
enforced by the choice of :math:`V`.
Thus we have the final weak form: find :math:`\\boldsymbol{A} \\in V` such that

.. math::
   \\int_{\\Omega}
   (\\mu^{-1} \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}) \\cdot
   (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{v})\\ \\mathrm{d}x =
   \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}\\ \\mathrm{d}x
   \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{v} \\in V.


For this application :math:`\\Omega` is taken to be the cross section of the
coaxial cable, and it is assumed that the cable has infinite length. It is
assumed that the functions :math:`\\boldsymbol{J}`, :math:`\\boldsymbol{A}` as
well as and any :math:`\\boldsymbol{v} \\in V` depend only on coordinates
:math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2` in the cross-section plane, and have a nonzero
component only in the perpendicular direction to the cross-section plane. In
other words, they are assumed to have the following form

.. math::
   \\boldsymbol{J} &= J(x_1, x_2) \\boldsymbol{e_3}

   \\boldsymbol{A} &= A(x_1, x_2) \\boldsymbol{e_3}

   \\boldsymbol{v} &= v(x_1, x_2) \\boldsymbol{e_3}

This reduces the problem to two dimensions. Taking the curl of a function of
the assumed form and substituting the result in the weak form gives a more
familiar weak form in the cross-section plane: find :math:`A \\in V` such that

.. math::
   \\int_{\\Omega}
   \\mu^{-1} (\\nabla A \\cdot \\nabla v)\\ \\mathrm{d}x =
   \\int_{\\Omega} J v\\ \\mathrm{d}x \\quad \\forall v \\in V.


In order to actually compute the inductance (per unit length) of the cable, a
current is passed through the inner conductor while an equal but opposite
current is passed through the outer conductor. The energy (per unit length)
stored in the produced magnetic field is computed as

.. math::
   E = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mu^{-1} |\\nabla A|^2\\ \\mathrm{d}x

However, the energy (per unit length) stored in the magnetic field of the
inductor can also be stated in terms of its inductance (per unit length) as

.. math::
   E = \\frac{1}{2} L I^2,

where :math:`L` is the inductance (per unit length) and :math:`I` is the
current passed through the inductor. Thus

.. math::
   L = \\frac{2 E}{I^2}


Capacitance
-----------

Capacitance of the cable is computed using the electrostatic equations

.. math::
   \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E} = \\boldsymbol{0}

   \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{D} = 0

and the constitutive relation

.. math::
   \\boldsymbol{D} = \\epsilon \\boldsymbol{E},

where :math:`\\epsilon` is the permittivity of the medium.

Since :math:`\\boldsymbol{E}` is curl-free, it can be written in terms of a
scalar potential :math:`U` as

.. math::
   \\boldsymbol{E} = -\\nabla U

Thus we have the strong form for the scalar potential :math:`U` as

.. math::
   -\\nabla \\cdot (\\epsilon \\nabla U) = 0.

However, this equation is only meaningful in a dielectric medium. In a
conductor, the electric field is zero, and thus the potential is constant (and
conceptually :math:`\\epsilon \\rightarrow \\infty`). The conductors need to
be excluded from the computation domain.

In any case, the equation has the familiar weak form: find :math:`U` such that

.. math::
   \\int_{\\Omega} \\epsilon \\nabla U \\cdot \\nabla v\\ \\mathrm{d}x = 0
   \\quad \\forall v \\in V.

Consider again the cross-section plane of the coaxial cable, with the cable
itself extending out-of-plane into infinity. Take :math:`U` to depend only on
the coordinates :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2` in the cross-section plane. This
again reduces the problem to two dimensions.

Due to conducting media in the cross-section, the problem needs to split into
two domains: the first domain consisting of the inner insulator and the second
domain consisting of the space outside the outer conductor. In both domains,
we have a non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition for :math:`U` on the
conductor surfaces, while in the second domain the potential has a homogeneous
Neumann condition on the free space boundary.

In order to actually compute the capacitance (per unit length) of the cable, a
potential is set on the inner conductor while an equal but opposite potential
is set on the outer conductor. The energy (per unit length) of the produced
electic field is computed as

.. math::
   E = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\epsilon | \\nabla U |^2\\ \\mathrm{d}x

However, the energy (per unit length) stored in the electic field of a
capacitor can also be stated in terms of its capacitance (per unit length) as

.. math::
   E = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2,

where :math:`C` is the capacitance (per unit length) and :math:`V` is the
potential difference across the capacitor. Thus

.. math::
   C = \\frac{2 E}{V^2}.
