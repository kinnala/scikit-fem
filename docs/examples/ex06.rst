High-order plotting
-------------------

This simple example demonstrates the usage and visualisation of biquadratic
finite element basis. Many plotting tools, including matplotlib, provide tools
for visualising piecewise linear triangular fields. Visualisation of
higher-order basis functions cannot be done directly and the mesh should be
further refined just for visualisation purposes.

:class:`~skfem.assembly.InteriorBasis` object includes the method
:meth:`~skfem.assembly.InteriorBasis.refinterp` which refines and simultaneously
interpolates any solution vector. The resulting mesh is non-conforming,
i.e. the connectivity between neighboring elements is lost, and hence it can
be used only for visualisation purposes.

.. note::

   As of 0.4.0, this functionality is included in :func:`~skfem.visuals.matplotlib.plot`,
   i.e. inputting :class:`~skfem.assembly.InteriorBasis` instead of :class:`~skfem.mesh.Mesh`
   uses :meth:`~skfem.assembly.InteriorBasis.refinterp` automatically.
   The steps in this example are still useful when, e.g., exporting to different
   formats for visualization purposes.

As an example, we solve the Poisson equation in a unit square with zero boundary
conditions and biquadratic basis on quadrilateral elements. The quadrilateral
elements are defined using an isoparametric local-to-global mapping.
