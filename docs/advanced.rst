This section contains advanced discussions around the features of scikit-fem
with an aim to develop a more detailed understanding of the library.

.. _forms:

Anatomy of forms
================

We consider forms as the basic building blocks of finite element assembly.
Thus, it is useful to understand how forms are used in scikit-fem and how to
express them correctly.

The bilinear form corresponding to the Laplace
operator :math:`-\Delta` is

.. math::

   a(u, v) = \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \,\mathrm{d}x.

In order to express this in scikit-fem, we write the integrand as a Python
function:

.. doctest::

   >>> from skfem import BilinearForm
   >>> from skfem.helpers import grad, dot
   >>> @BilinearForm
   ... def integrand(u, v, w):
   ...    return dot(grad(u), grad(v))

.. note::

   Using helpers such as :func:`~skfem.helpers.grad` and
   :func:`~skfem.helpers.dot` is optional.  Without helpers the last line would
   read, e.g., ``u.grad[0] * v.grad[0] + u.grad[1] * v.grad[1]``.  Inside the
   form ``u`` and ``v`` are of type :class:`~skfem.element.DiscreteField`.
   The return value is a numpy array.

Here is an example of body loading:

.. math::

   b(v) = \int_\Omega \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y) v \,\mathrm{d}x.

This can be written as

.. doctest::

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from skfem import LinearForm
   >>> @LinearForm
   ... def loading(v, w):
   ...    return np.sin(np.pi * w.x[0]) * np.sin(np.pi * w.x[1]) * v

.. note::

   The last argument ``w`` is a dictionary of
   :class:`~skfem.element.DiscreteField` objects.  Its ``_getattr_`` is
   overridden so that ``w.x`` corresponds to ``w['x'].value``.  Some keys are
   populated by default, e.g., ``w.x`` are the global quadrature points.

In addition, forms can depend on the local mesh parameter ``w.h`` or other
finite element functions (see :ref:`predefined`).  Moreover, boundary forms
assembled using :class:`~skfem.assembly.BoundaryFacetBasis` can depend on the
outward normal vector ``w.n``.  One example is the form

.. math::

   l(\boldsymbol{v}) = \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \,\mathrm{d}s

which can be written as

.. doctest::

   >>> from skfem import LinearForm
   >>> from skfem.helpers import dot
   >>> @LinearForm
   ... def loading(v, w):
   ...    return dot(w.n, v)


The form definition always returns a two-dimensional numpy array.  This can be
verified using the Python debugger:

.. code-block:: python

   from skfem import *
   from skfem.helpers import grad, dot
   @BilinearForm
   def integrand(u, v, w):
       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # breakpoint
       return dot(grad(u), grad(v))

Saving the above snippet as ``test.py`` and running it via ``python test.py``
allows experimenting:

.. code-block:: none

   tom@tunkki:~/src/scikit-fem$ python -i test.py
   >>> asm(integrand, Basis(MeshTri(), ElementTriP1()))
   > /home/tom/src/scikit-fem/test.py(7)integrand()
   -> return dot(grad(u), grad(v))
   (Pdb) dot(grad(u), grad(v))
   array([[2., 2., 2.],
          [1., 1., 1.]])

Notice how ``dot(grad(u), grad(v))`` is a NumPy array with the shape `number of
elements` x `number of quadrature points per element`.  The return value should
always have such shape no matter which mesh or element type is used.

The module :mod:`skfem.helpers` contains functions that make the forms more
readable.  An alternative way to write the above form is

.. doctest:: python

   >>> from skfem import BilinearForm
   >>> @BilinearForm
   ... def integrand(u, v, w):
   ...     return u[1][0] * v[1][0] + u[1][1] * v[1][1]

.. note::

    In fact, ``u`` and ``v`` are simply named tuples of NumPy arrays with the
    values of the function at ``u[0]`` or ``u.value`` and the values of the
    gradient at ``u[1]`` or ``u.grad`` (and some additional magic such as
    implementing ``__array__`` and ``__mul__`` so that expressions such as
    ``u * v`` work as expected).

Notice how the shape of ``u[0]`` is what we expect also from the return value:

.. code-block:: none

   tom@tunkki:~/src/scikit-fem$ python -i test.py
   >>> asm(integrand, Basis(MeshTri(), ElementTriP1()))
   > /home/tom/src/scikit-fem/test.py(7)integrand()
   -> return dot(grad(u), grad(v))
   (Pdb) !u[0]
   array([[0.66666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667],
          [0.66666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667]])


.. _dofindexing:

Indexing of the degrees-of-freedom
==================================

.. warning::

   This section contains details on the order of the DOFs.
   Read this only if you did not find an answer in :ref:`finddofs`.

After finite element assembly we have the linear system

.. math::

   Ax = b.

What is the order of the unknowns in the vector :math:`x`?
The DOFs are ordered automatically based on the mesh and the element type.  It
is possible to investigate manually how the DOFs match the different
topological entities (`nodes`, `facets`, `edges`, `elements`) of the mesh.

.. note::

   **Nomenclature:** In scikit-fem, `edges` exist only for three-dimensional
   meshes so that `facets` are something always shared between two elements of
   the mesh.  In particular, we refer to the edges of triangular and
   quadrilateral meshes as `facets`.

For example, consider the triquadratic hexahedral element and the default
cube mesh:

.. doctest::

   >>> from skfem import *
   >>> m = MeshHex()
   >>> m
   <skfem MeshHex1 object>
     Number of elements: 1
     Number of vertices: 8
     Number of nodes: 8
   >>> basis = Basis(m, ElementHex2())
   >>> basis
   <skfem CellBasis(MeshHex1, ElementHex2) object>
     Number of elements: 1
     Number of DOFs: 27
     Size: 296352 B

The DOFs corresponding to the nodes (or vertices) of the mesh are

.. doctest::

   >>> basis.nodal_dofs
   array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]])

This means that the first (zeroth) entry in the DOF array corresponds to the
first node/vertex in the finite element mesh (see ``m.p`` for a list of
nodes/vertices).

Similarly, the DOFs corresponding to the edges (``m.edges`` for a list of
edges) and the facets (``m.facets`` for a list of facets) of the mesh are

.. doctest::

   >>> basis.edge_dofs
   array([[ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])
   >>> basis.facet_dofs
   array([[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])

All DOFs in ``nodal_dofs``, ``edge_dofs`` and ``facet_dofs``
are shared between neighbouring elements to preserve continuity.
The remaining DOFs are internal to the element and not shared:

.. doctest::

   >>> basis.interior_dofs
   array([[26]])
   
Each DOF is associated either with a node (``nodal_dofs``), a facet
(``facet_dofs``), an edge (``edge_dofs``), or an element (``interior_dofs``).
