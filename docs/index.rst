The documentation of scikit-fem
===============================

`scikit-fem <https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem>`_ is a lightweight Python 3.6+
library for performing `finite element assembly
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method>`_. Its main purpose is
the transformation of bilinear forms into sparse matrices and linear forms into
vectors.  The library supports triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and
hexahedral meshes as well as one-dimensional problems.

This document contains the efforts to improve the user documentation of the
project. Currently, the main learning resource consists of the
examples that are continuously improved. In case you have any further
questions, do not hesitate to drop in and say hello at our `Gitter chat
<https://gitter.im/scikit-fem>`_.
