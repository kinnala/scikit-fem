`scikit-fem` is a lightweight Python 3.6+ library for performing [finite element
assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method). Its main purpose
is the transformation of bilinear forms into sparse matrices and linear forms
into vectors.  The library supports triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and
hexahedral meshes as well as one-dimensional problems.

The library fills an important gap in the spectrum of finite element codes.
The library is *lightweight* meaning that it has *minimal dependencies*.
It contains *no compiled code* meaning that it's *easy to install* and
use on all platforms that support NumPy.  Despite being fully interpreted, the
code has a reasonably *good performance*.

*The following benchmark (`docs/examples/performance.py`) demonstrates the time
spent on finite element assembly in comparison to the time spent on linear
solve.  The given numbers were calculated using a ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop (7th
gen).  Note that the timings are only illustrative as they depend on, e.g., the
type of element used, the number of quadrature points used, the type of linear
solver, and the complexity of the forms.  This benchmark solves the Laplace
equation using linear tetrahedral elements and the default direct sparse solver
of `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve`.*

## Installation

The most recent release can be installed simply by `pip install scikit-fem`.
Optionally you can use `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-fem`.

## Examples

Forms are defined using an intuitive syntax:

```python
from skfem import BilinearForm
from skfem.helpers import dot, grad

@BilinearForm
def laplace(u, v, w):
    return dot(grad(u), grad(v))
```

Meshes can be initialized manually, loaded from external files using
[meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio), or created with the help of special
constructors:

```python
import numpy as np
from skfem import MeshLine, MeshTri, MeshTet

mesh = MeshLine(np.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0]))
mesh = MeshTri.load("docs/examples/square.msh")
mesh = MeshTet.init_tensor(*((np.linspace(0, 1, 60),) * 3))
```

We support [many common finite
elements](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem/blob/master/skfem/element/__init__.py#L51).
Below the stiffness matrix is assembled using second-order tetrahedra:

```python
from skfem import InteriorBasis, ElementTetP2

basis = InteriorBasis(mesh, ElementTetP2())
A = laplace.assemble(basis)  # type: scipy.sparse.csr_matrix
```

More examples can be found in the [gallery](https://scikit-fem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/listofexamples.html).

## Documentation

The project is documented using Sphinx under `docs/`.  Built version of the
documentation can be found from [Read the
Docs](https://scikit-fem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting help

If you encounter an issue and cannot find help from the documentation,
you can use the Github issue tracker to [ask questions using the question label](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem/issues?q=label%3Aquestion).
Try to provide a snippet of code which fails
and include also the version of the library you are
using.  The version can be found as follows:
```
python -c "import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.get_distribution('scikit-fem').version)"
```

## Dependencies

The minimal dependencies for installing `scikit-fem` are
[numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and
[meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio).  In addition, many
[examples](https://scikit-fem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/listofexamples.html) use
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualization.  Some examples
demonstrate the use of other external packages; see `requirements.txt` for a
list of test dependencies.

## Testing

The tests are run by Github Actions.  The `Makefile` in the repository root has
targets for running the testing container locally using `docker`.  For example,
`make test_py38` runs the tests using `py38` branch from
[kinnala/scikit-fem-docker-action](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem-docker-action).
The releases are tested in
[kinnala/scikit-fem-release-tests](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem-release-tests).
